# fastapi
Deployment of ML app using Fast api

<h4>Abstract</h4>

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. The main objective behind this repository is to learn, undernstand and implement fastapi web framework with <b>Machine learning project</b> based <b>Bank Note Authentication UCI data</b>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<h5>FastAPI</h5>
<h5>Dataset</h5>

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Note:-Dataset can be used for Binary Classification sample problems
